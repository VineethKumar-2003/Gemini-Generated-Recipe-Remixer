Pat the foie gras lobes dry with paper towels.  Generously season both sides of each lobe with the spice mixture, ensuring even coverage.  Carefully place the lobes in a terrine mold or a tightly sealed rectangular container, overlapping slightly, layering with the thyme sprig in between.  Pour the Sauternes and Cognac over the foie gras. Cover tightly with plastic wrap, pressing down firmly to eliminate air pockets. Weigh down with a heavy object (e.g., a weighted plate) and refrigerate for at least 4-6 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld and the foie gras to cure.\n\n2. **Prepare the Fig and Balsamic Gastrique:** In a small saucepan, combine the quartered figs, balsamic vinegar, sugar, and red wine vinegar. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally until the figs have softened and the mixture has reduced and thickened to a syrupy consistency (approximately 15-20 minutes).  Remove from heat and set aside to cool slightly.\n\n3. **Toast the Brioche:** Preheat your oven's broiler. Spread the softened butter evenly over both sides of the brioche slices. Place the brioche slices on a baking sheet and broil for 1-2 minutes per side, or until golden brown and lightly toasted. Keep a close eye to avoid burning.\n\n4. **Assemble the Snack:** Carefully unmold the foie gras terrine.  Cut into thick slices (approximately 1.5-2cm). Arrange the foie gras slices on a serving plate. Spoon the fig and balsamic gastrique generously over the foie gras. Serve immediately alongside the toasted brioche slices.  Garnish with a few fresh fig quarters, if desired, for an elegant presentation.\n\n\n**Note:** This recipe requires high-quality ingredients for optimal results.
